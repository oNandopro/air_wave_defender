            <p>Your order was processed by our merchant buygoods.com. It will be buygoods.com that shows up on your credit card or billing statement! If you are not the cardholder, inform them of this! If you purchased any upgrades, they will show up as separate transactions. If you need support, email us at contact@airwavedefenders.com.</p><br>
            <p>We hope that you'll absolutely love our products.</p><br>
            <p>You are fully protected by a 100% money-back return policy.</p><br>
            <p>Here's how it works.</p><br>
            <p>If for any reason you're dissatisfied at any time during the first 60 days after purchase, simply return the product and ask for a full refund. You'll get your money back. That's a firm promise and commitment. If you have any questions about your return, please e-mail your question to contact@airwavedefenders.com. Please include the words "Return Question" in the subject line of your e-mail so that we can address your question quickly.</p>
            <p>Finally, and this is totally optional and at your discretion, we sure would appreciate it if you would include some explanation for why you're returning the product so we can work to make the product better. We want satisfied customers and we appreciate & welcome your feedback.</p>
            <p>In order for your full refund to be processed the product must arrive at our fulfillment facility within sixty (60) days of the original purchase date. Failure to include all bottles purchased be they empty, full or partially full , or failure to clearly write your order details as specified above so that a member of our fulfillment center staff can clearly read and allocate your return will both result in our inability to refund you. You pay for the return shipping.
                <br>Once our fulfillment center has received the package and relayed the correct information to us, you will be issued a refund. Your refund will be credited back to your bank account and may take up to 3-5 business days to show in your statement, depending on the speed of the processing bank. 
                <br>All returns need to be shipped via USPS to the following address:
